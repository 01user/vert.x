h2. What is vert.x ?

<br>

vert.x is a framework for creating scalable, concurrent, real-time, web-enabled applications.

Some other features:

* Polyglot. Write your application in JavaScript, Java, Ruby or Groovy. It's up to you. Or mix and match several programming languages in a single application.

* No more worrying about concurrency. vert.x allows you to write all your code as single threaded. Yet, still allows you to scale your applicatin across available cores.

* Has an elegant event based API

h2. Code example

<pre class="prettyprint">
  var server = new vertx.HttpServer();

  // Also serve the static resources
  server.requestHandler(function(req) {
    if (req.path == '/') {
      req.response.sendFile('web/index.html');
    } else if (req.path.indexOf('..') == -1) {
      req.response.sendFile('web' + req.path);
    }
  }).listen(8080, 'localhost');

  function vertxStop() {
    server.close();
  }
</pre>
