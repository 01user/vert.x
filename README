node.x
------

What is node.x?

* Node.x embraces the power and simplicity of an event based model like in Node.js, Python Twisted or Ruby EventMachine and extends it
to more languages and real scalability.

* Polyglot: We provide the same api in multiple languages, including: Ruby (JRuby), Java, (+ Scala?, Groovy?, Clojure?, Mira?, Jython?, Rhino? etc going ahead)

* Understands 10+ protocols out of the box (TCP, SSL, HTTP, HTTPS, AMQP, Websockets, etc)

* Truly scalable. It's multi-threaded (unlike node.js) so actually uses all the cores on your server, and reduces you having to spin up multiple processes to make it scale.

* Interface safely with legacy blocking applications without compromising your application

* The foundation for a cross language ecosystem on top of which could be built web frameworks, application containers etc.

Architecture
------------

The node.x core is written most probably in Java or Scala. There is where it all happens.

We then provide the thin node.x API in multiple languages. The language specific API layer will be very thin and will
delegate to the node.x core to get the work done.

API
---

The API will be based around a simple event callback model, much like node.js.

The API will provide a large set of modules for working with various protocols including for instance:

TCP, SSL, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, Websockets, Socket.IO

And going ahead:

SMTP, AMQP, STOMP, memcached etc

Building core
-------------
from root dir: ant

Running Ruby examples
--------------------

cd src/examples/ruby

cd into specific directory and run script. Some examples have their own READMes too

Current status
--------------

Working proof of concept with several examples exists.
