Simple proxy server example
===========================

A very simple HTTP proxy which simply proxies requests/response from a client to a server

We have:

a) A simple http server which just takes the request and sends back a response in 10 chunks
b) A simple http client which sends a http request with 10 chunks (via the proxy server)
c) A proxy server which simply sits in the middle proxying requests and responses between client and server

To run, open three consoles.

In console 1, run the http server: ./http_server.sh
In console 2, run the proxy server: ./proxy_server.sh
In console 3, run the http client: ./http_client.sh
