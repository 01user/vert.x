HTTP server and client using SSL/TLS
====================================

To run the server: ./https_server.sh

Then point your browser at https://localhost:4443

OR run the http client ./https_client.sh

In this example the client is configured to trust all server certificates, and the server has it's own hand rolled
certificate in the keystore.
