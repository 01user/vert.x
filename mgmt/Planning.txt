Supported Languages
===================

Initially:

Java
Ruby
Groovy
JavaScript (Initially Rhino, then hopefully moving to DynJS as it matures)


Going ahead:
                                                      7
Clojure
Python
Scala


TODO
====
1) Consider wrapping libev in Java API
2) Consider using disruptor https://code.google.com/p/disruptor/ as alternative to concurrent queues
3) SSL exceptions aren't very nice
4) StartTLS
5) endHandler handlers not currently being called - check this
7) Synchronous versions of filesystem ops ??
8) Filesystem lock + watch
12) Netty needs to implement event loop
13) HTTP server side 100-continue handling
15) Netty should build timers into event loop
19) Make Java vertx methods static ??
21) HTTPClient should pool HTTP connections in same way as redis client, i.e. have HTTPPool and HTTPConnection class -
otherwise can't do proper pipelining since can't guarantee same connection.

For people who don't care about pipelining, then all the request methods should ALSO live on the pool - this is a
shortcut to writing .connection() and clos()ing each time

Websockets should also be obtained immediately from a call to websocket() on the HTTPPool class, this will return
a ClientWebsocket instance, which will try and connect() immediately. If anything is written before being connected
it will go into a pending list, like with HttpClientRequest

22) Per thread connection pools. If we can have multiple connection pools, one for each core thread then they don't
need any synchronization.
23) HTTP connection reconnection.
24) Look at Redis cluster support in client
25) Core JSON support - wrap Jackson?
28) Cleanup package config and core vs optional dependencies
29) Event bus should be paritioned into "application groups" for isolation.
30) DHT
31) JSON API for Event bus
32) Event bus: change acknowledge to reply and use same mechanism for sending messages, cache sender in local cache and
lookup there first
34) Think about combining distributed event bus and in vm event bus (register_handler/send_to_handler)
35) Wire protocol so non JVM runtimes can join the event bus - provide event bus API in MRI ruby etc
(We could even define a wire format gossip protocol to distribute topology to non JVM members, they could then join the
network)
37) Groovy vertx app should be script like JS/Ruby
38) Redo website
39) Rewrite readme
40) Update wiki on vertx run
41) Add bodyHandler to HttpClientResponse, also maybe move this functionality out, since useful in net too?? Implement in Ruby too
